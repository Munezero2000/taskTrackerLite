## Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Task Management System with Roles

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a task management system with roles. This system will provide functionalities for users to manage tasks, organize them into projects, and collaborate within teams.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**

This task management system is intended for use by individuals and teams to manage their tasks and projects effectively. It will cater to various user groups, such as students, freelancers, small businesses, or any organization that needs to manage tasks and track progress.

**2.2 Product Functions**

* **User Management:**
    * User registration and login
    * User profile management (including username, email, password)
    * Role-based access control (RBAC)

* **Task Management:**
    * Create, edit, and delete tasks
    * Assign tasks to users
    * Set task priorities (low, medium, high)
    * Specify due dates for tasks
    * Mark tasks as completed, in progress, or cancelled
    * Filter and search tasks

* **Project Management:**
    * Create, edit, and delete projects
    * Assign owners to projects
    * Associate tasks with projects
    * View project details and tasks

* **Collaboration:**
    * Leave comments on tasks

**2.3 User Characteristics**

* Individual users
* Team members
* Project managers
* Administrators (optional)

**2.4 General Constraints**

* The system should be accessible through a web browser or a mobile application (future enhancement).
* The system should be secure and protect user data.
* The system should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users and tasks.

**2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies**

* Users have a basic understanding of web applications.
* The system will be deployed on a web server with a database management system.

**3. Specific Requirements**

**3.1 User Management**

* Users should be able to register for an account with a username, email address, and password.
* The system should validate user input during registration (e.g., email format, password strength).
* Users should be able to manage their profiles, including updating their information.
* The system should implement RBAC, where different user roles have varying levels of access and permissions (e.g., administrators can manage all users and projects, while team members can only manage tasks assigned to them).

**3.2 Task Management**

* Users should be able to create tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level.
* Users should be able to assign tasks to other users.
* The system should provide a way to filter and search tasks based on various criteria (e.g., status, priority, assignee, project).
* Users should be able to track the progress of tasks and mark them as completed, in progress, or cancelled.

**3.3 Project Management**

* Users should be able to create and manage projects.
* Projects should have a name, description, owner, and an optional end date.
* Users should be able to associate tasks with projects.
* The system should allow users to view project details and associated tasks.

**3.4 Collaboration**

* Users should be able to leave comments on tasks to collaborate with team members.

**3.5 Security Requirements**

* The system should implement secure password hashing and storage mechanisms.
* User sessions should be managed with appropriate timeouts.
* The system should be protected against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

**3.6 Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** The system should be responsive and provide fast loading times for tasks, projects, and user interactions.
* **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all technical abilities.
* **Availability:** The system should be available for use with minimal downtime.
* **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to accommodate a growing number of users and tasks.

**4. References**

* Any relevant industry standards or regulations.

**5. Appendix**

* Data model diagrams (e.g., Entity Relationship Diagram - ERD) can be included as an appendix to illustrate the relationships between entities in the system.
